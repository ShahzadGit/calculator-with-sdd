# Specification Quality Checklist: Calculator UI Enhancements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED ✅

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1 for accessibility and visual hierarchy, P2 for enhancements)
- Comprehensive accessibility requirements meeting WCAG AA standards
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focusing on user outcomes
- Well-defined edge cases covering browser compatibility, motion preferences, and color blindness
- Explicit out-of-scope items preventing feature creep

**Notes**:
- Specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are fully specified
- All 36 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 12 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Ready to proceed to `/sp.plan` phase

## Readiness Assessment

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All checklist items pass. Proceed with `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan.
