## 📖 About SKILLs Collection

These skills were created and refined through hands-on Next.js development with Claude on the web. Each skill emerged from real project needs, capturing best practices, common patterns, and solutions to recurring challenges. They represent distilled wisdom from building actual applications—not theoretical exercises.

## Skills Used

This project was built using specialized Claude Code skills for Next.js development:

- **code-review-and-improve**: Systematic code review focusing on accessibility, React/Next.js best practices, and code quality improvements

**Improvements from code review (Phase 8 - Polish):**

- **Semantic HTML**: Replaced `<input>` with `<output>` element in Display component for proper semantic markup
- **Accessibility**: Added `role="region"` and `aria-label` to main calculator container for better screen reader navigation
- **Performance**: Moved constant arrays and strings outside components to avoid unnecessary re-creation on every render
  - Extracted `operations` array in OperationButtons component
  - Extracted `numbers` and `buttonClasses` constants in Keypad component
- **Earlier improvements**: Comprehensive aria-labels, aria-live regions, aria-pressed states, and semantic HTML throughout all components

- **nextjs-component-generator**: Generate production-ready, drop-in Next.js components with App Router compatibility, proper framework usage

- **nextjs-layout-builder**: Generate production-ready Next.js layouts and page structures including app shells, dashboards, landing pages

### UI Enhancements (Feature 002)

The following Next.js skills were used to enhance the calculator UI with modern design patterns:

**Skills Applied:**

1. **nextjs-component-generator**: Enhanced all calculator components with:
   - TailwindCSS utility classes for responsive design
   - Custom color palette (calculator.* colors in tailwind.config.ts)
   - Glassmorphism container styling (.glass-container)
   - Neumorphism button effects (.neomorphic-raised, .neomorphic-pressed)
   - Touch target compliance (min-h-touch, min-w-touch at 44px)

2. **code-review-and-improve**: Systematic accessibility improvements:
   - WCAG AA color contrast verification (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Focus ring utilities for keyboard navigation (.focus-ring)
   - Reduced-motion support (prefers-reduced-motion media query)
   - Semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes

**UI Enhancement Files Modified:**

| Component | Enhancement |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tailwind.config.ts` | Custom color palette, animations, touch targets |
| `src/app/globals.css` | Glassmorphism, neumorphism, animation utilities |
| `src/app/page.tsx` | Gradient background with calculator colors |
| `src/components/Calculator.tsx` | Glass container, responsive spacing |
| `src/components/Display.tsx` | Display background, responsive text |
| `src/components/Keypad.tsx` | Number button styling, neumorphic effects |
| `src/components/OperationButtons.tsx` | Operation colors, selected state |

**New Test Files:**

- `tests/unit/ui-accessibility.test.tsx` - jest-axe accessibility tests
- `tests/visual/component-snapshots.test.tsx` - Visual regression tests
